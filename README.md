# ShcrÃ¶dinger's Flask

> Nya!

Example codes for my talk on web app development with Flask for
[guluc3m](http://gul.es). Slides (in Spanish) can be found at [my
archive](http://archive.rmedgar.com/talks/schrodingers_flask).

The repository also includes a *complete* app (Nyanter) to play with and
a version with bits and pieces of code removed so anyone can try to complete it
or **improve it**.

## Usage

Clone/Download the repository and install the requirements with:

~~~shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

Although I'd recommend setting up
[Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) first.
